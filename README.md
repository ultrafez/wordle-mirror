# Wordle mirror

This is a mirror of the hosted assets for the web-based word game [Wordle](https://www.dailywordle.com), originally made by [powerlanguage](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/). I have mirrored these assets into this repo on the [announcement](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/media/new-york-times-wordle.html) that the New York Times has bought Wordle, and may monetise it in future. I want to preserve the ability to play the game in its current form regardless of what the NYT does with it.

Since the word of the day is calculated in the client-side game code, anybody could host their own mirror of the game and get the same word and experience as everybody else, no matter who is hosting the game.
